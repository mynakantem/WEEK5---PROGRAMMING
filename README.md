Overview:
Week 5 focused on enabling Java programs to interact with external data sources and utilize powerful runtime capabilities. 
We covered how to read, write, and manipulate CSV and JSON files, and explored how Java uses annotations and reflection to process metadata and manipulate code dynamically.

Topics Covered:
Day 1: CSV Data Handling
  - Understanding CSV (Comma Separated Values) format
  - Reading from and writing to CSV files in Java
  - Using BufferedReader and FileWriter for manual parsing
  - Parsing and storing structured data into Java objects

Day 2: JSON Data
  - Introduction to JSON format
  - Reading and writing JSON in Java
  - Introduction to Jackson and Gson libraries
  - Converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa
  - Pretty printing and filtering JSON data

Day 3: Annotations and Reflections
  - What are annotations?
  - Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings)
  - Custom annotations
  - Introduction to Java Reflection API
  - Accessing class metadata at runtime
  - Dynamic method invocation and use cases

Prerequisites:
  - Familiarity with Java file handling, OOPs, and basic I/O streams
  - Completion of Weeks 1 through 4
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
  - An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

How to Use This Repository:
Each topic is housed in a separate folder containing code examples, sample data files, and notes.
Browse through each dayâ€™s folder to explore practical examples and build your understanding of external data handling and advanced Java runtime capabilities.
